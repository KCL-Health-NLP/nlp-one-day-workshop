# Natural Language Processing (NLP) - a one day introductory workshop
*A one day workshop on NLP with a health record focus prepared for [MQ Mental Health Research](https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/) and [DATAMIND](https://datamind.org.uk/) by [King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn)*

## Learning objectives

- Understand the need to process language when re-using electronic health records for research, the computational difficulties language poses, and how natural language processing (NLP) can help to solve these.
- Appreciate the main paradigms of NLP, and their relative strengths and weaknesses.
- Develop an overview of how language is represented computationally, and how these representations can be used to build models of text.
- Gain a basic understanding of neural networks, their use in NLP, and generative AI.
- Gain practical experience of building simple NLP applications using Python.
- Appreciate the broader health research context in which NLP can sit, and the development process needed to implement NLP in this context.


## Target audience and skills required

- The course is aimed at early career health researchers who want to explore the basic concepts of NLP and its application to electronic health record text.
- The course is not primarily aimed at those with an extensive computer science or data science background, though you are welcome to come along, and perhaps benefit from a different perspective.
- This is not a theoretical course, though we will provide pointers for further reading after the course.

## Format

The course will be delivered through:

- Pre-workshop video lectures and preparatory material.
- A one day hands-on practical workshop. This will mainly consist of Python practicals, interspersed with very short presentations.
- Suggested reading for those of you who want to explore the topic further.
