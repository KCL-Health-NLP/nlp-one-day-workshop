# Natural Language Processing - a one day introductory workshop
**A one day workshop on NLP with a health domain focus**
**Prepared for [MQ Mental Health Research](https://www.mqmentalhealth.org/) and [DATAMIND](https://datamind.org.uk/) by [King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn)**

## Learning objectives

- Understand the need to process language when re-using electronic health records for research, the computational difficulties language poses, and how natural language processing (NLP) can help to solve these.
- Appreciate the main paradigms of NLP, and their relative strengths and weaknesses.
- Develop an overview of how language is represented computationally, and how these representations can be used to build models of text.
- Gain a basic understanding of neural networks and their use in NLP.
- Gain practical experience of building simple NLP applications using Python.
- Appreciate the broader health research context in which NLP can sit, and the development process needed to implement NLP in this context.

## Pre-course material

Some of this pre-course material is taken from a 10 day taught course on NLP, and on occasion refers to other parts of that course. Just ignore those references - you only need the main content you need.
